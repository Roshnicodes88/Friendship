    <h2>Friends</h2>
    <p class="p">Friends are best in the world. They help us when we are in trouble. When we are in trouble they helps us to get rid from the problem and when we are happy they celebrate with us and be happy. They treat us like a brother and sister. they take care us.  I would like to tell some words for my Friends,"Because of you, I laugh a little harder, cry a little less, and smile a lot more." </p>
